## Setup WordPress Coding Standards

```
cd $(pear config-get php_dir)/PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards
```

```
git clone git://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards.git
```

To setup WordPress Coding Standards
```
ln -s WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress WordPress
ln -s WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Core WordPress-Core
ln -s WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-VIP WordPress-VIP
ln -s WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Extra WordPress-Extra
```

There are other standards as well such as WordPress-Core, WordPress-VIP & WordPress-Extra.

The WordPress standard encompasses a superset of the sniffs that the WordPress community may need. It includes sniffs for Core standards, but then it also includes sniffs for the WordPress VIP coding requirements, as well as some best practice Extras. If you just use the WordPress standard, you'll get everything. But if you're not working in the WordPress VIP environment, for example, this won't good for you. So there are additional standards included in this project, standards which include a subset of the sniffs in the WordPress standard. You can use all of the following as standard names when invoking phpcs:

- **WordPress-Core:** Sniffs that seek to implement the Core coding standards and go no further.
- **WordPress-VIP:** Core sniffs plus sniffs specifically implemented to check against the VIP coding requirements
- **WordPress-Extra:** Core sniffs plus any extras that are best practices but could be controversial.
